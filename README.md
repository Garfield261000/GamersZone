Created a web page using React.js where you can check ratings of your favorite games.
Displayed are some AAA rated games and a Search Bar which uses a filtering algorithm to search for your favorite games. 
Instead of using traditional CSS styles, BootStrap(pre-defined HTML classes with specific CSS stylings) are used.
